The customised scheduling algorithm is shortest job first. The next process it chooses to execute has the shortest execution time. When a new process arrives, it is inserted into the queue of processes ordering by its execution time. It performs better than baselines when more shorter processes are arriving and executed before longer processes because it reduces average waiting time hence reduces turnaround time and time overhead. It performs worse when more shorter processes are arriving and executed later than longer processes. One possible page replacement algorithm is not recently used algorithm. Least recently used processes are swapped out before recently used ones. It reduces the likelihood of recently used processes being evited and takes time to load again. However, it is not optimal as it requires timestamping and may suffer from inconsistency.
